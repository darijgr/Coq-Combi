(** * The list of the permuted tuple of a given tuple

The main goal is to show that, given a sequence [s] over an [eqType] there
are only finitely many sequences [s'] which are a permutation of [s] (that is
[perm_eq s s']) and to show that the number is a multinomial coefficient.

- [permuted_tuple t] == a sequence of tuples containing (with duplicates) all
             tuple [t'] such that [perm_eq t t']
- [permuted_seq s] == a sequence of seqs containing (with duplicates) all seqs
             [s'] such that [perm_eq s s']
- [permuted t] == sigma typle for tuple [t'] such that [perm_eq t t'].  this
             is canonically a [fintype], provided the type of the elements of
             [t] is a [countType].

- [permutedact t s] == the [n] tuple [t] permuted by the permutation [s]
- [permuted_action] == the corresponding action of the symmetric group ['S_n]

The main result is the cardinality of the set of permuted of a tuple expressed
as a multinomial [card_permuted_multinomial].

(** * Action of ['S_n] on permuted for and [n.-tuple T].

There is no use defining an action on general tuple because most of the lemmas
on actions assume that the type acted upon is a [finType]. We could require
moreover that the underlying type is a [fintype] so that the set of tuple is a
[fintype] too, but the use we have in mind is [T = nat] allowing to deal with
the action on monomials. Instead of that, we decide to act only on the sigma
type [permuted].
